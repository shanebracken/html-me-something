                <p> Hello World! My name is Shane Bracken, Cat Father of two. I would like to welcome you to my first web-site ever!</p>
                <p>This site is decicated to my two boys, Jude, and Benny.Enjoy :]</p>

            <h2>Jude</h2>
                <img src="images/jude.jpg" alt="jude" height="100" width="100">
                <p>this is Jude. Jude is the oldest out of the bunch.Jude was adopted originally by my mother , Valerie in lebanon illinois. Neighbor found him as a kitten, all alone, without his mother, and gave him to her.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, due to my mothers asthma , after a year, she gave him to me to take care of.</p>    
                <p>Jude is a mischievous cat. He likes to do everything that he is not suppose to do. Things like, get into the trash, open the fridge, steal food, sneak out side. When you scold him, he rolls over on his back.</p>
            <h2>Benny</h2>
                <img src="images/benny.jpg" alt="benny" height="100" width="100">
                <p>This is Benny. Benny was adopted from PetCo. We got him so Jude would not be lonely. Benny and Jude are quite the opposite. Jude is self-sufficient , he doesn't require much attention. Benny on the other hand, needs all the attention, and he is quite vocal.</p>
